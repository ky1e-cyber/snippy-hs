# snippy-hs

Configurable Haskell well-typed snippets/terms generator.

## Status \[!\]

Project isn't finished and for now in hiatus.

## Why?

It is a fun exercise in type theory / Haskell's type system.

### Or actual use cases:
1. [Fuzzing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing)
2. In source [code caves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_cave) (e.g. for obfuscation)
3. Language exploration (it's fun to see what crazy constructions are actually well-typed in Haskell)
4. Puzzlers creation

## Project TODO

1. [x] Basic expression generation (lib)
2. [ ] Basic type generation (lib)
3. [ ] **Code rewrite**
4. [ ] More sophisticated terms generation (lib)
5. [ ] CLI client
6. [ ] Configuration
7. [ ] *Parallelize* term generation
